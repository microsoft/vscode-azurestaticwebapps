# azext-azureappservice

This is intended to be a temporary folder to contain the `AppSettingsTreeItem` code.
It was the only thing being imported by the Static Web Apps extension, but the appservice package creates a lot of dependencies that we don't want to pull in.
This will be removed once the `AppSettingsTreeItem` code is moved to another package.
