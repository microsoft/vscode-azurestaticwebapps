## Create an API for your static web app
This extension has a dependancy on the [Azure Functions Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurefunctions) to create APIs and endpoints.  Your SPA project needs to have an "api" folder that contains all of the endpoints.

    **INSERT SCREENSHOT HERE**
1. Select a language for the API, either JavaScript or TypeScript

## Updating your static web app

1. Commit and push your changes to the GitHub repository that your static web app is configured to.  It will then use [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to update your app.
    > If you create a PR, GitHub Actions will create a staging environment with your new changes.  Manage these builds under the "Environments" tree item.
