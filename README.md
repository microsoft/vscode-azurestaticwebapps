## Create your first static web app

1. Click the '+' button in the explorer to setup a new static web app

    ![Create Static Web App](resources/readme/create_static_web_app.png)
1. Authorize access to your GitHub account so the extension can find your repositories

1. Select a repository and branch that will be deployed to the static web app
    > If your local project has a remote configured, the extension will default to that repository
1. Provide the app folder name
    > Location of your application code. For example, '/' represents the root of your app, while '/app' represents a directory called 'app'.
1. Provide the api folder name (optional)
    > Location of your Azure Functions code. For example, '/api' represents a folder called 'api'. If you don't have an Azure Functions project yet, don't worry!  This is optional so just leave this blank.
1. Provide the build artifact folder name
    > The path of your build output relative to your apps location. For example, setting a value of 'build' when your app location is set to '/app' will cause the content at '/app/build' to be served.

## Updating your static web app

Commit and push your changes to the GitHub repository that your static web app is configured to.  It will then use [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to update your app.

If you create a pull request through GitHub, GitHub Actions will create a staging environment with your new changes live.  Your Production environment and staging environments are all listed within your Static Web App as well as application settings.

> **IMPORTANT:** The application settings only apply to the backend API of an Azure Static Web App.

## Create a HTTP Function for your static web app

You can add a serverless API to your static web app by creating a HTTP Functions project.

1. Open your static web app project in your Visual Studio Code workspace
1. Select the button to create a new HTTP Function

    ![Create HTTP Function](resources/readme/create_http_function.png)

1. Provide a HTTP Function name that is unique to your API
1. If this is your first HTTP Function, select a language for your API
